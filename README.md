# Spatialization-Pipeline
Code to simulate room acoustics using Pyroomacoustic.

Simulate_rirs.py file contains the code to simulate the room impulse rooms of different sizes.

We use the Binaural SDM code to generate the BRIR properties using the simulated RIR code and a custom HRTF (any HRTF can be used) (Link to original code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/BinauralSDM/tree/main)
